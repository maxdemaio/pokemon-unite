# pokemon-unite
Pokémon Unite - data science on pokemon stats

## How do I run this locally?
- Download the source code (just the [uniteStatsNotebook.ipynb file](./uniteStatsNotebook.ipynb))
- Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
    - File>Open notebook>Upload
    - Upload the notebook
- Runtime>Run all

Voilà! You've now ran the code yourself. If you want different levels/stats just change out the block where I set the `level` and `stat` variables and re-run.

## Example graphs
